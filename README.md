# WpfAssessment
Repository containing the solution for the WPF Assessment

There was no enough time to implement unit tests => During the demonstration I can implement a few of them.

The is a sample json file included in the solution to populate the database with initial data.

The sample file shoul be placed at this specific location: C:\ProgramData\WPF Assessment\Data

There is a entity relational diagram included in the solution, however I didn't have enought time to create the architecture diagram.

But I can explain how the architecture works during the presentation or draw the diagram live.

Than you for your compreehension.
